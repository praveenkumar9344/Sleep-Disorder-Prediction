# Sleep Disorder Prediction

This project aims to predict sleep disorders (such as Insomnia and Sleep Apnea) using machine learning techniques based on lifestyle and physiological data. It was developed as part of a summer internship project at Jaya Engineering College.

## Overview

The system analyzes features such as sleep duration, stress level, BMI, occupation, and physical activity to detect patterns associated with sleep disorders. It uses classification models like Decision Tree and Random Forest to make accurate predictions.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn (Decision Tree, Random Forest)
- Jupyter Notebook
- CSV Dataset (Sleep Health & Lifestyle)

## Features

- Data preprocessing and feature engineering
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and visualization
- Sleep disorder classification with up to 89% accuracy
- Confusion matrix, classification report, and distribution plots
- Insights into how occupation, BMI, and gender influence sleep health

## Security & Compliance

- Data anonymization and secure handling
- Aligned with healthcare privacy standards (HIPAA, GDPR)

## Future Enhancements

- Integration with real-time wearable data
- Deep learning models (CNN, RNN)
- Personalized health recommendations
- Telemedicine and comorbidity prediction features
